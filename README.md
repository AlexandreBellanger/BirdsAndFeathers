This is my first try at making a Minecraft mod.

The aim of this project (apart from learning how to mod Minecraft) will be to add more birds, colored feathers, feather blocks, feather armor, and arrows with colored flectching

I am following this tutorial made by Kaupenjoe (but I am using NeoForge instead of Forge):

# Implemented features:
- colored feathers
  - obtainable by dying feathers
  - can be used in most recipes involving feather
- feather blocks
  - craftable with 9 feathers
  - can be unpacked to retrieve 9 feathers
  - beds can be crafted with feather blocks instead of wool
    
# Work in progress
- feather armor
  - very bad protection and durability
  - bad enchantability
  - give some protection against kynetic energy damage
  - when crouching, the feather cap animates like a cuckatoo's crest
  - when enchanted, feather boots become winged boots
    - they then add +1 to feather falling                                    
  - phantoms are neutral to players wearing feather armor and no other armor type except elytra

# Planned
- several new bird species
  - some with special AI
  - parrots and other birds drop coresponding feathers
- arrows with colored fletching
  - tipped arrows with colored fletching
