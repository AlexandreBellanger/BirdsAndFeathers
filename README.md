This is my first try at making a Minecraft mod.

I am following this tutorial made by Kaupenjoe :

However I am using NeoForge instead of Forge, and I try to make my own things.



The aim of this project (apart from learning how to mod Minecraft) will be to add the following things to the game:

- several new bird species
  - some with special AI
  - drop coresponding feathers
    
- colored feathers
  - dropped by parrots and other birds
  - obtainable by dying feathers
    
- feather blocks
  - craftable with 9 feathers
  - can be unpacked
  
- feather armor
  - very bad protection and durability
  - bad enchantability
  - give some protection against kynetic energy damage
  - when crouching, the feather cap animates like a cuckatoo's crest
  - when enchanted, feather boots become winged boots
    - they then add +1 to feather falling                                    
  - phantoms are neutral to players wearing feather armor and no other armor type except elytra
    
- arrows with colored fletching
  - tipped arrows with colored fletching
