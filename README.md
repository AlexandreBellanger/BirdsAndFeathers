This is my first try at making a Minecraft mod.

The aim of this project (apart from learning how to mod Minecraft) will be to add more birds, colored feathers, feather blocks, feather armor, and arrows with colored fletching

I am following this tutorial made by Kaupenjoe (but I am using NeoForge instead of Forge):

# Implemented features:
- 15 colored feathers
  - obtainable by dying feathers
  - parrots drop matching colored feather
  - can be used in most recipes involving feather
- 16 feather blocks
  - craftable with 9 feathers
  - can be unpacked to retrieve 9 feathers
  - beds can be crafted with feather blocks instead of wool
  - share most of the wool properties including the ability to stop sounds from reaching skulk sensors
    
# Work in progress
- feather armor
  - crafted using feathers 
  - very bad protection and durability
  - bad enchantability
  - give some protection against kinetic energy damage
  - when crouching, the feather cap animates like a cockatoo's crest
  - when enchanted, feather boots become winged boots
    - they then add +1 to feather falling                                    
  - phantoms are neutral to players wearing feather armor and no other armor type
    - however they can wear some non-armor items (elytra, pumpkin, heads...)

# Planned
- several new bird species
  - most with custom AI
    - some hunt and/or are hunted by other mobs
  - drop corresponding feathers
  - Main bird ideas (I will probably not implement all of them)
    - _specie (biome; feather color):_
    - crow (dark forest / old taiga; black)
    - kingfisher (river; cyan)
    - green woodpecker (birch forest; green)
    - flamingo (swamp; pink)
    - gull (beach; white?)
    - swan (river; white)
    - vulture (badlands; brown)
    - eagle (stony peaks / windswept hills; ?)
    - swallows / tits / other passerines (various forest?; various colors)
    - wild goose (plains; gray?)
- arrows with colored fletching
  - tipped arrows with colored fletching
